  Hi, my name is Xavier, I am 22 years old and live between Melbourne and Warrnambool. I was born in New Zealand and moved all around for my dad’s work, before settling down in Warrnambool where I grew up most of my life.  My father is Italian, hence the tricky last name, whilst my mother is Australian. I enjoy playing sports such as basketball, tennis, and soccer. I also spend my time playing guitar and piano or getting hooked on video games.

Interest in IT
<p>
</p>
<br> <!-- New line -->
My interest in IT and computers started around the age of 12 when I became increasingly interested in video games. I began to wonder how the games I was playing worked and followed whatever commands I input on my controller.
I chose to go to RMIT mostly because the degrees offered by the university fit my interests the most. It was also my goal throughout my childhood to move to Melbourne to attend university after I completed year 12.
Whilst being excited to move to Melbourne and began studying at university, I also was determined to learn and retain information that can be used to start a career. I expected my time at uni to be a fun and adventurous time of my life. Now being in my final year, I can safely say that all my expectations were met, and I had a great time.

Ideal Job
<P>

https://www.seek.com.au/job/50389438?type=standard#searchRequestToken=12ad051f-e7e9-493e-b294-c256334ae7e7
<P>
My ideal IT job is to be a game developer. This position would be beneficial for me as it would allow me to tie in my career with something I already greatly enjoy and have a passion for. This position requires sufficient skills in C++. Unfortunately, at this stage of my life, I do not have the required skills to tackle this job. To obtain the necessary skills I would have to complete a degree in programming and game development, and further develop my understanding of the programming world.
Myer-Briggs test – for this test, my personality type was a ‘mediator’ (INFP-T).
Online learning style test – my results for this test were that I am an Auditory learner.
Five Factor Model personality test - the results of this test highlighted that I have two predominant personality traits. Them being Openness and Neuroticism.

IT Project Idea
<p>
For my Project Idea, I have decided to develop an app that can construct the appearance of an individual’s face using an image of the back of that person’s head.
<p>
I have decided to introduce this technology to mainly assist law enforcement with the identification of criminals caught on CCTV footage. A study conducted in 2017 by the Nottingham Trent University highlighted the importance of CCTV, detailing how when CCTV footage is available, it has proved useful in 65% of cases by assisting in the completion of the investigation. I believe that 65%, whilst being high, is not a good enough number and should greatly be increased. The app can also be used my members of the public to assist in helping to track down old family members.
<p>
The app will be developed to be accessible on iOS devices. It will be free to download as our main interest is to assist the police. However, we aim to make a profit through ad revenue. The app will be designed to be easily accessible by people from all levels of technological backgrounds. The app will consist of a simple layout with an option to upload photos. Users can simply open the app, click on the upload button in the middle of the screen, choose a photo to upload from their photo library, and the map takes care of the rest by analyzing the features of the photo and matching it with our worldwide database of photos.
<p>
To develop this app, I plan to hire a group of experienced coders proficient in the use of the coding language Xcode. The processing of the massive amounts of images being included will require a number of powerful pc’s with proficient graphics cards and processers to be able to handle the large amounts of data.
<p>
I am hoping that the successful development and launch of the app will fulfill its intended purpose of assisting the police in the identification and arrest of known criminals caught on CCTV. The impact of this app will directly make the community a safer place for law abiding citizens.

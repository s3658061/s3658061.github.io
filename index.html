  Hi,
  My name is Xavier, I am 22 years old and live between Melbourne and Warrnambool. I was born in New Zealand and moved all around for my dad’s work, before settling down in Warrnambool where I grew up most of my life.  My father is Italian, hence the tricky last name, whilst my mother is Australian. I enjoy playing sports such as basketball, tennis, and soccer. I also spend my time playing guitar and piano or getting hooked on video games.

Interest in IT
<p>
My interest in IT and computers started around the age of 12 when I became increasingly interested in video games. I began to wonder how the games I was playing worked and followed whatever commands I input on my controller.
I chose to go to RMIT mostly because the degrees offered by the university fit my interests the most. It was also my goal throughout my childhood to move to Melbourne to attend university after I completed year 12.
Whilst being excited to move to Melbourne and began studying at university, I also was determined to learn and retain information that can be used to start a career. I expected my time at uni to be a fun and adventurous time of my life. Now being in my final year, I can safely say that all my expectations were met, and I had a great time.

<P>
My ideal IT job is to be a game developer. This position would be beneficial for me as it would allow me to tie in my career with something I already greatly enjoy and have a passion for. This position requires sufficient skills in C++. Unfortunately, at this stage of my life, I do not have the required skills to tackle this job. To obtain the necessary skills I would have to complete a degree in programming and game development, and further develop my understanding of the programming world.
Myer-Briggs test – for this test, my personality type was a ‘mediator’ (INFP-T).
Online learning style test – my results for this test were that I am an Auditory learner.
Five Factor Model personality test - the results of this test highlighted that I have two predominant personality traits. Them being Openness and Neuroticism.
